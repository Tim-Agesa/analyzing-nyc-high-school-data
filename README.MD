Project Name: ANALYZING NYC HIGH SCHOOL DATA

Tools Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook

Description of Project:
In this project I decided to look keenly at SAT scores. SAT(Scholastic Aptitude Test), is a test that high school seniors in the U.S. take every year. 
The SAT has three sections, each is worth 800 points. Colleges use the SAT to determine which students to admit. High average SAT scores are usually 
indicative of a good school.

New York City(NYC) has a significant immigrant population and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores 
is a good way to determine whether the SAT is a fair test.

Workflows:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Analyzing and Visualizing Data.
