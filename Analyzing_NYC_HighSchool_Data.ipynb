    "### Introdution:\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests and whether they're unfair to certain groups. Given our prior knowledge of this topic, investigating the correlations between __SAT scores__ and __demographics__ might be an interesting angle to take. We could correlate __SAT scores__ with factors like __race, gender, income, and more__.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "[__The SAT__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT), or __Scholastic Aptitude Test__, is an exam that U.S. high school students take before applying to college. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Colleges take the test scores into account when deciding who to admit, so it's important to perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The test consists of three sections, each of which has 800 possible points. The combined score is out of 2,400 possible points (while this number has changed a few times, the dataset for our project is based on 2,400 total points). Organizations often rank high schools by their __average SAT scores__. The scores are also considered a measure of overall school district quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "New York City makes its data on high school __SAT scores__ available online, as well as the __demographics__ for each high school.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Research:\n",
    "\n",
    "After research we learnt the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only high school students take the __SAT__, so we'll want to focus on high schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- New York City is made up of __five boroughs__, which are essentially distinct regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- New York City schools fall within several different school districts, each of which can contains dozens of schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our datasets include several different types of schools. We'll need to clean them so that we can focus on high schools only.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each school in New York City has a unique code called a __DBN__ or district __borough number__.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Aggregating data by district allows us to use the district mapping data to plot district-by-district differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of Project:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will study the correlations between various columns and __SAT scores__. In particular, we want to figure out the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __How does SAT_score correlate with factors like race, gender, average class size, safety_score amongst other interesting columns.__"
